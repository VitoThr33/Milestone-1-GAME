Game Controls: CLICK SCREEN TO START GAME

                NEW GAME: CLICK SCREEN TO RESTART GAME

I created this game because flappy bird was pretty addicting and fun. 
I wanted to throw my spin on things as i would ultimately like a job somewhere in the sports world.
Therefore I created a meme-verseion of flappy where you are Lebron dodging as many championships as possible 
because lets admit it we all know Jordan is the GOAT!


BUGS I COULDNT FIX: GETTING THE GAME TO RESTART ONCE FINISHED MEDAL COUNT.
